# Lu-s-Wallpaper-Collection

## About
My personal wallpaper collection. All images are in the [jpeg-xl](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/) format.

## Contributing
You have the option to upload your own wallpapers through a pull-request, but remember that all files must be in the jpeg-xl format. To make it easier for you to switch your current files, I've designed a [bash-script](https://github.com/Lu-Die-Milchkuh/Lu-s-Wallpaper-Collection/blob/main/convert2jxl.sh) that will convert all image files in a directory to the required format.
